### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate software developer focused on clean code and being mindful of 
the future so that my code works great and as time goes on keeps its value. In 
other words, I am great to work with as I strongly believe that teamwork and 
mutual respect are keys to the success of any great project.

## My programming skills include

* PHP
* Laravel
* MySql

## My projects

* Internet bank webiste
* Cryto currency trading website
* Slot machine

## Who am I?
#### Hard worker

I consider challenges to be the greatest teacher and forward-moving force. JFK 
quote I live by - "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other 
things not because they are easy, but because they are hard."

#### Teamworker

Being the eldest of 10 children this skill is a matter of survival. What I have learned 
when sharing a living space with so many people is that mutual respect is what 
powers teamwork to make the dream work.

#### Enjoyer of life

I have a beautiful wife and a career I am passionate about. It's hard not to enjoy my life, but just in case, I always have my humor and positive thinking. Some recent examples:
* While parked, the right side of my car was crushed by a garbage truck. Two days later someone hit the left side of my wife's car and ran. While others might remember this as fate being terrible, I have always found it funny that it looked like I  had crashed into my wife's car.
* It was our one-month wedding anniversary. I get into the car to drive home, and start the engine, and, due to some faulty wire, the front of my car erupts in flames. After I managed to stop the fire and dealt with towing, I was left with only a good memory of how funny and ironic life is.

Cars or code can crash and burn, but I am always ready to put out fires and fix things.
