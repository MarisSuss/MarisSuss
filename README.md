### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer focused on clean code and being mindful of 
the future so that my code works great and as time goes on keeps its value. In 
other words, I am great to work with as I strongly believe that teamwork and 
mutual respect are the keys to the success of any great project.

## Who am I?
#### Hard worker

I consider challenges to be the greatest teacher and forward-moving force. JFK 
quote I live by - "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other 
things not because they are easy, but because they are hard."

#### Teamworker

Being the eldest of 10 children this skill is a matter of survival. What I have learned 
when sharing a living space with so many people, mutual respect is what 
powers teamwork to make the dream work.
